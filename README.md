# ETF Selection Algorithm
1. Define the asset class based on the investment objective.
1. Select ETFs that:
	1. Faithfully replicate the index.
	1. Have a size of **at least 100 million $** under management.
	1. Have an age **greater than 3 years**.
	1. Have a complete or optimized **physical replication**. If synthetic replication, ensure that the swap counterparties are numerous.
1. For the same asset class, choose ETFs with lower costs. Check:
	1. Bid-ask spread.
	1. Management commission.
	1. Administrative costs.
	1. Transaction costs for synthetic replication ETFs.
1. For the same asset class, choose ETFs with greater underlying diversification.
1. Ensure that the ETF is harmonized (covered by UCITS regulations).
1. Verify if the ETF is subject to securities lending.
1. Verify if the ETF is subject to currency hedging. For relatively stable exchange rates, it is not necessary.
# ETC
ETCs and ETNs suffer from counterparty risk, which means that your deposit could be completely lost if not properly collateralized. ETCs are not a long-term investment because they are subject to the contango effect.

# Notes
NAV and purchasing price could be different.
